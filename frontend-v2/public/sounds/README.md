# Sound Files for Fruit Ninja

To enable sound in the game, add the following sound files to this directory:

- `slice.mp3`: Sound that plays when cutting a fruit
- `bomb.mp3`: Sound that plays when cutting a bomb
- `gameover.mp3`: Sound that plays when the game ends
- `background.mp3`: Background music for the game

You can find free sound effects on websites like:

If these files are not present, the game will still function without sound.
